		  spectral element) and standard finite differences are
		  applied to solve the Burgers equation with small viscosity
		  (). This equation admits a (nonsingular) thin internal

		  are to be obtained. From the reported computations, it
		  appears that spectral schemes offer the best accuracy,
		  especially if coordinate transformation or elemental
		  subdivision is used to resolve the regions of large
		  variation of the dependent variable.}
