# Evaluation of the application of PIML and PINN methods

*Last edited: 2024-10-07*

This repository contains code, data, manuscripts, and other files used in my research on PIML (Physics-Informed Machine Learning) and PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network) methods. Some case studies used in the study:

- Data-driven parameter discovery of one-dimensional Burgers' Equation using PINN.

- Evaluation of PIML and other methods applied to the RRTMGP gas optics scheme used in ECMWF's ecRad radiation module.

The acronym PD1B24 originally comes from the first studies entitled *PINN Discovery 1D Burgers 2024*.

The idea of ​​this repo is to be a place for controlled experiments of new ideas and theories that emerge over time, evaluation of results, direct observation of implementations, review, correction, curiosities, and learning from mistakes. This repois a work in progress and is subject to constant change.

Description of some files and subdirectories. More information can be found inside the subdirectories:

- [BurgersPINN](BurgersPINN) - case study of application of PINN in solving the Burgers' Equation .

- [RRTMGP](RRTMGP) - case study of application of the PIML method in the RRTMGP gas optics scheme.

- [manuscript-1](manuscript-1) - Qualification Exam LaTeX sources.

- [manuscript-2](manuscript-2) - Proposal Exam LaTeX sources.

This work is based on the works of:

- Raissi et al. <https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs/>
- Ukkonen et al. <https://github.com/peterukk/>
- And others.
